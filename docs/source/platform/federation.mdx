If you're running your GraphQL infrastructure using GraphQL services that comply with the [federation spec](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/federation/federation-spec/), there are a variety of things you'll want to consider when using the Apollo GraphQL platform. The key difference between running GraphQL with a monolithic server instead of running multiple services orchestrated by a [gateway](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/federation/implementing/#running-a-gateway) is that your GraphQL schema is dynamically defined by [partial schemas](<LINK_TO_GLOSSARY>), which compose to form an overall schema for your graph. Since the GraphQL schema is the central hub of the data in your graph, it's important to **track each implementing service's partial schemas** in order to ensure that they are able to compose into a valid schema, and also to [validate](<LINK_TO_SCHEMA_VALIDATION>) that the changes any service makes do not affect the [operations made by clients](LINK_TO_METRICS).

## Inspecting your Graph
> Using the `apollo service:list` command or the UI to understand your graph

## Registering your graph
> Using the `apollo service:push` and `apollo service:check` command to track changes to your graph

[//]: # (Description: An overview of how and when to use `apollo service:push` and `apollo service:check` in your CI/CD workflow, linking out to the specifics of usage in the specific docs (#502 and #503). Ideally this section includes some screenshots of the workflows in practice.)

## Running with managed federation
> Taking control of how service changes bubble up to the Apollo Gateway

[//]: # (Description: An overview of the concept of managed federation, linking out to the details on gateway defaults w/ an API key and the specfics on setting up the lifecycle options. Ideally this section has a diagram of managed federation lifecycle.)
